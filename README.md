RH 1.5D is an open source, massively-parallel radiative transfer code for spectral synthesis in stellar atmospheres. It is a modified version of the [RH code by Han Uitenbroek](http://www4.nso.edu/staff/uitenbr/rh.html).

For detailed installation and running instructions, please see the online documentation at https://rh15d.readthedocs.io/. RH 1.5D depends on two external libraries: [MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) and [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/).

RH 1.5D is also documented in the paper by [Pereira & Uitenbroek, 2015, A&A, 576](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...574A...3P). If you use RH 1.5D for your work, we would appreciate if you would acknowledge it by citing its paper and also the RH paper of [Uitenbroek, 2001, ApJ, 557](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...557..389U). In addition, if the journal allows it please include a link to this repository.
